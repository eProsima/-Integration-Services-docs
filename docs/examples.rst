Examples
========

Integration Services (IS) ships with a folder with examples. In addition, exists another project derived from IS
named `FIROS2 <https://github.com/eProsima/FIROS2>`_ with more examples.

In IS you can find the following examples:

In this example, IS makes use of both, static and dynamic types, showing the different mechanism to define types
supported by IS.

In this example we configure IS to use a TCP tunnel to communicate two Fast-RTPS ShapesDemo in different ways.
