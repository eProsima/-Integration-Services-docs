Concepts and Terms
==================

Before configuring and using *Integration Service* here you can find the concepts and terms you should know Before
reading the rest of the documentation.

* *Integration Service* is often named as *IS*.
* An ``IS Writer`` (``ISWriter`` or simply *Writer*) is a component able to write data to a destination protocol.
* An ``IS Reader`` (``ISReader`` or simply *Reader*) is a component able to read data from a source protocol.
* A *Transformation Function* is a function that converts between data types.
* A *Transformation Library* is a library that contains *Transformation Functions*.
* An *Endpoint* is a *Writer* or *Reader*.
* A *Connector* is a component that relates a *Reader* with a *Writer* and optionally a *Transformation Function*.
* An ``IS Bridge`` (or ``ISBridge``) is a component that holds a set of connectors and manages them.
* A *Bridge Library* (or *bridge*) is a library that provides *Writers* and *Readers* to support additional protocols and optionally more complex *bridges*.
