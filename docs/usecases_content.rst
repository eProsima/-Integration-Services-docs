Typical Use-cases
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Typical scenarios in which *Integration Service* is relevant are:

* Communication among systems using different protocols which handle incompatible types, topics, and services.
* Integration of sub-systems into arbitrarily complex systems using different protocols.
* Communication through the Internet between systems hosted by logically separated LANs located in different geographical regions.

In this part of the documentation we discuss representative examples demonstrating all these
*Integration Service* functionalities.
For each example, the user is guided step-by-step through the
installation procedure and environment preparation necessary to have the use-cases set up and working.

Namely, we will go through the following:

- :ref:`dds_ros2_bridge`
- :ref:`dds_change_of_domain`
- :ref:`ros1_ros2_bridge`
- :ref:`ros2_change_of_domain`
- :ref:`ros2_websocket_comm`
- :ref:`fiware_ros2_comm`
- :ref:`wan_tcp_tunneling`

.. _important_remarks:

A compulsory prerequisite for running the examples of the following sections is
to have *Integration Service* correctly installed as explained in the :ref:`getting_started` section.
Please make sure to follow all the steps presented therein before proceeding.
