Same Protocol
=============

This page gathers all the existing examples for *Integration Service* that connect applications
written under the **same protocol**. They are not focused on showing how effective
*Integration Service* is capable of translate one protocol's types into anothers (see
:ref:`examples_different_protocols` for that purpose); instead, this section tries depicting how easy
is for *Integration Service* to bridge logically isolated applications written under the same protocol.
