===========

This section provides the user with an in-depth knowledge of *Integration Service*'s main aspects. First,
it provides an overview of the core structure.
Then, it details the internal structure of a *System Handle* which serves a guide for users to
create brand new *System Handles* for middlewares which are not integrated into the *Integration Service* ecosystem.
Following, it discusses how to configure *Integration Service* by means of YAML files, explaining how to fill the required fields,
depending on the needs of the specific use-case and middlewares involved in the communication.
Finally, it provides an overview of the *System Handles* existing to date.
